     <p>Not everyone knows this, but the Sheffield's Student Union consists of three buildings.</p>
     <img src="">
     <p>The original was the Graves Building, built in the 1930's. The building was deisigned by Stephen Welsh and was later donated to the students by a local buisnessman and city benefactor, J. G. Graves.</p>
     <img src="">
     <p>The University of Sheffield then built on two more buildings from 1959-1962. These were the University House and the Link Building.</p>
     <img src="">
     <p>The second two buildings have been extended multiple times since 1994.</p>
     <p>One of the most impressive additions was the new main entrance, which was finished in 2010.</p>
